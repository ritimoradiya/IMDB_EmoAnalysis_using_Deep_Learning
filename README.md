# IMDB_EmoAnalysis_using_Deep_Learning
Developed a sentiment analysis model for IMDB movie reviews using deep learning techniques, aiming to classify movie sentiment based on textual data.

Collected and explored the dataset, preprocessed textual data through tokenization, padding, and embedding matrix creation, and built two RNN models (LSTM and BiLSTM).

Achieved an accuracy of 87% after training and evaluating both models, and successfully tested the model on unseen and live data for real-world performance validation.
